# cookbook
A notebook of Jupyter notebook goodies that I use mostly on [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dbrunton/cookbook/master).

1. [Markdown](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Markdown.ipynb) is a syntax for formatting text
1. [Pandas](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Pandas.ipynb) are basically python spreadsheets
1. [Drawing](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Turtle%20Drawing.ipynb) is a fun way to learn some basics
1. [Widgets](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Widgets.ipynb) are little UI components
1. [MARC Records](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Turtle%20Drawing.ipynb) are used in some libraries
