A notebook of Jupyter notebook goodies that I use mostly on Binder (you can click the badge below to launch them there).

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dbrunton/cookbook/master)

1. [Markdown](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Markdown.ipynb) is syntax for formatting text
1. [Python](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Python.ipynb) is a programming language with lots of built-in libraries
   - [Pandas](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Pandas.ipynb) are basically python spreadsheets
   - [Drawing](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Turtle%20Drawing.ipynb) is a fun way to learn some basics
   - [Widgets](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Widgets.ipynb) are little UI components
   - [MARC Records](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Turtle%20Drawing.ipynb) are used in some libraries
