Markdown is a formatting dialect. It has some built-in formatting options:

# Big Headings

and

## Little Headings

Normal un-formatted text is allowed. [Links](https://loc.gov) are embedded in a particular way, and there are
1. numbered
2. lists

or

* bulleted
* lists
    * and sub lists
    * using indentation

Formatting options include

__bold__ and *italic* and ```code formatting```

<hr />
<a href="https://copyright.gov">HTML <em>can</em> also be embedded</a><hr />

Those are all the features I use.
